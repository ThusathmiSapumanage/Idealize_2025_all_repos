# IDEALIZE 2025 Backend

1. Background ;
Receiving timely support in the healthcare industry can change the odds of survival. Because hospitals need essential items—such as blood, medicines, medical supplies, or volunteers—the reality is that there is no sophisticated platform that can connect those essential needs effectively with potential donors who are willing to donate. Smart Donation Matching Platform seeks to correct this by creating an optimized, tech-enabled platform for hospital donations.

2. Problem Statement ;
Health centres lack basic commodities like various blood groups, hospital supplies, funding support, and volunteers' donations for most of the time. Concurrently, would-be donors in need to donate but have no reliable, secure, and transparent means of donating blood. Existing structures for donation are either unclear or inefficient, thereby creating idle resources and delayed care in time-critical situations. 

3. Objective ;
With the aim of developing a microservice-based platform that enables real-time hospital needs matching with charitable donors, through dynamic filtering, ranking, and interactive chatbot assistant—enabling faster, better contribution to the medical fraternity.
